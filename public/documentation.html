            name: "Quentin Tarantino", bio: "Born in Knoxville, Tennessee,
            Tarantino grew up in Los Angeles. He began his career as an
            independent filmmaker with the release of Reservoir Dogs in 1992, a
            crime thriller film which was in part funded by money from the sale
            of his screenplay True Romance (1993). Empire magazine hailed
            Reservoir Dogs as the "Greatest Independent Film of All Time". His
            second film, Pulp Fiction (1994), a crime comedy, was a major
            success among critics and audiences and won him numerous awards,
            including the Palme d'Or and the Academy Award for Best Original
            Screenplay.[3][4] He wrote the screenplay for the horror comedy film
            From Dusk till Dawn (1996),[5] in which he also starred. Tarantino
            paid homage to the blaxploitation films of the 1970s with Jackie
            Brown (1997), an adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel Rum Punch.",
